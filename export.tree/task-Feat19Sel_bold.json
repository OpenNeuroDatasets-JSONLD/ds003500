  "TaskName": "Feature Target, 1 and 9 shapes, Feature Selection",
  "Instructions": "Press index finger if there is a yellow shape. Press middle finger if there are no yellow shapes.",
  "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented 12, 18-trial, blocks of a feature selection task. In half of the blocks, trials consisted of the presentation of a single shape and in the other half of the blocks, trials consisted of the presentation of a 3x3 array of shapes. Block type alternated, beginning with a single shape block. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible by pressing a button below their index finger if a yellow shape was present and pressing a button below their middle finger if no yellow shapes were present, regardless of the number of shapes on the screen. At the beginning of each block the participant was reminded of the type of block with warning text reading ‘One’ or ‘Many’ that lasted 2300 ms followed by 300ms of blank screen. In single shape blocks, participants were presented with a single shape that was either a target (yellow trapezoid or yellow triangle) or a distractor (blue triangle or red trapezoid). Trials were balanced to contain equal amounts of each distractor and target type. Trials were pseudo-randomized to ensure that the same shape was not presented in more than three consecutive trials. In array blocks, stimuli consisted of 3x3 matrices of shapes that contained 8 distractor stimuli and one additional shape that was either a target or a distractor. Trials were counterbalanced to include an equal number of targets in each of the nine positions across stimuli. Distractors were positioned in each stimulus such that there were no more than three of the same distractor adjacent on a side. All stimuli used in this dataset are provided in the stimuli director at the root level of the dataset. For array stimuli, distractors/target stimuli were presented such that they filled in the hole of the array of 8 distractors. Each block contained 18 trials arranged into six three-trial sets. In each trial participants were presented with the stimulus for 1400ms followed by an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 450, 600 or 750ms. Participants could respond as soon as the stimulus appeared and until the end of the ITI. Each set of three trials contained one trial with an ITI of 450ms, one with an ITI of 600ms and one with an ITI of 750ms such that total duration of each set of three trials was 6000ms. This variable duration of ITI was implemented in order to limit participants ability to pace. Order of trial ITI within a triplet was randomly sampled. Stimuli were sampled such that an individual stimulus was presented with the same ITI across subjects but not necessarily in the same order.",
